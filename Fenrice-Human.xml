          <p class="flavor">Humans are creative and innovative creatures. Always wanting to break barriers and create 
              something out of nothing to advance the world. They are the people you will mostly see within the walls of Arkadia.</p>
          <h4>PATHS IN LIFE</h4>
          <p>Humans value their paths in life. Whether they become a soldier who fights for the city, a person who is involved
              in the politics of the city, or a commoner who just wants to live as is. Each contribute their own to maintain the
              ecological balance of Arkadia.</p>
          <h4>CREATURES OF CONQUEST</h4>
          <p><i>"I came, I saw, I conquered."</i> is a quote profusely used said by man. Humans are mostly aligned to take what they
              can take, and control what they can control.</p>
