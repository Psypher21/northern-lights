     <description>
        <p class="flavor">Leonara are the dominant race of the deserts, populating the arid realm
             in large but scattered numbers. They are not necessarily a hostile race but
             they are protective of their own and powerful enough as a united nation to resist
             invasion. They believe in strength, loyalty, and most of all, tradition.</p>
        <p><strong>LION MEN:</strong> The leonara are a beast-race, and look very much like bipedal lions.
             Like lions, they have feline features, the males have large manes and paws. Their feet
             are jointed like a lion's and some are born with a tail, while others without. Their more
             human characteristics are their opposable thumbs, upright stature, and the basic shape of
             their chest and waist.</p>
